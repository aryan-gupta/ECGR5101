# ECGR5101
Code for my Advanced Embedded Systems Class

## Liability and Honor Code ##
I am NOT responsible for your grade or any Honor Code Violation. I only
place my code on GitHub so I can sync between computers and use version
control. This repository was kept private until final grades were submitted
to prevent violations and cheating, but was then publicized to display my coding
abilities for job interviews and related such. Use at your own risk.
